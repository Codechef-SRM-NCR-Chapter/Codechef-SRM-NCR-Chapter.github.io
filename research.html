							<b>•	Research Intern @ UNSW, Australia (May 2022-Present)</b>
							<br><br>
							<b>Topic: Cancer Tumours Classification</b>
							<br><br>
							<b>Abstract:</b>His research in UNSW, Sydney, under the supervision of Dr. Sonit Singh involves working on a Pan Cancer Model, where a total of 33 types of cancers will be classified. Deep Learning Algorithms will be applied to find new trends in the classification of the cancer tumours. With the use of classifiers and sci-kit learn Library the goal will be achieved.
